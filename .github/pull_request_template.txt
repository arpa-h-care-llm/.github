## :gear: Release Notes 
*Add a bullet point summary of the feature, model improvements, or algorithmic changes, along with possible migration guides if this is a breaking change.*
- If this is a model-related PR (e.g., training, fine-tuning, evaluation), list any significant changes to architecture or hyperparameters.
- Include relevant code snippets, examples of the new ML features, or links to updated documentation (if it appends or changes any model/data pipeline interfaces).

## :books: Documentation
- Update any relevant sections in your projectâ€™s ML pipeline, preprocessing steps, or model design docs.
- Document the reasoning behind model architecture decisions, changes to data augmentation, or hyperparameter tuning.
- If introducing a new model or ML workflow, please include a high-level overview and references to any related papers or resources.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Model Metrics & Performance
*Detail the performance improvements, new metrics used, or model evaluation changes.*
- Attach relevant model performance results (e.g., accuracy, F1 scores, AUC-ROC, precision-recall) from training and evaluation, including a comparison to the baseline.
- Mention the datasets used for testing and whether results are reproducible across different seeds.
- If applicable, include an ablation study summary or model explainability techniques used (e.g., SHAP, LIME).

## :white_check_mark: Testing
*Please ensure that the PR meets the testing requirements set by CodeCov and that new functionality is appropriately tested.*
- Have you added unit tests for any new functions or methods?
- If contributing new ML functionality, include tests for model training and evaluation pipelines.
- Mention how edge cases (e.g., missing data, model convergence issues) are handled and tested.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Training & Environment Setup
*If the contribution involves model training or modifications to the ML pipeline:*
- Mention the hardware setup (e.g., GPU/TPU) and software (frameworks, versions) required for reproducibility.
