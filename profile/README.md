# ARPA-H CARE LLM 

## Introduction
This GitHub organization contains code development related to the goals and sub-projects of the larger ARPA-H funded CARE LLM project, led by the [Daneshjou](https://github.com/DaneshjouLab) and Akshay labs at Stanford University. Scientists, developers, clinicians, and engineers contribute to this multi-disciplinary project, aiming to harness the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address critical challenges in healthcare communication.

## Background
Miscommunication in healthcare settings leads to significant costs, including preventable patient deaths and adverse outcomes. With healthcare workers often overstretched, timely patient inquiries are challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to ease communication and administrative burdens, showing potential in medical diagnosis, clinical text summarization, and automation of clinical documentation. However, LLMs require precise prompting and robust evaluation methods to avoid harmful inaccuracies and biases.

## Goal
This project addresses the challenges of prompting and evaluating patient-facing LLM-based chatbots, particularly in radiology imaging results and hospital discharge instructions. We aim to align our solutions with clinical and societal values by developing pragmatic criteria after consulting with key stakeholders, including healthcare professionals and patients.


## Ethical AI Use and Accessibility
Our project is committed to ethical AI use, ensuring our tools avoid biases and support all patients, including those with disabilities or from diverse cultural backgrounds. We prioritize human-centered design and rigorous data security measures to protect stakeholder information.


## Contributing
